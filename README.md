1. ### JS Introduction
- JS is single threaded and have a single call stack. Hence, synchronous

- In order Javascript to run, we need more than JS Engine which includes Memory Heap and Call Stack, we need Javascript Run-Time Environment. It is part of browser, which includes, Web APIs(AJAX, setTimeout, DOM), Event Loop, Callback Queue

- For Javascript to be non blocking, we create Callback Functions.

2. ### Data Types
Total 9 data types in Javascript.

- 6 primitives data type:
    - String
    - Number
    - Big Int
    - Boolean
    - Symbol
    - Undefined
- Null → special primitive (typeof instance === "object")
- Object → includes arrays, sets, date, map
- Function → every function constructor is derived from Object Constructor. typeof instance === "function"

3. ### ES6 Features
ES6 is more popularly known as  ECMAScript 2015 which is a scripting language based on specification and standardization by ECMA international company in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16232.

To increase the development of Javascript as independent implementation, ES6 was created to standardize Javascript. So now if you say ES6 it mean Javascript with ES6 features.

The wide array features of ES6 make this a very beneficial and efficient scripting language which is useful for everything related to JavaScript technology.

1. Block scoping - introduction to let and const keywords
2. arrow functions
3. Helper functions like forEach, map, filter, reduce, find
4. classes 
5. default function Parameter
6. rest and spread operator
7. Destructuring of arrays and objects
8. Promises
9. String interpolation
10. for...of Loop
